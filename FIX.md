we have some tasks, tackle it one after another:

1. we were implemnting a CMS for storefront images/videos/gifs. Ready to start on that' yeah what i mean is that each frame could accept image, video or gif format files but we were not able to implement it check what we currently have in the codebase, analyze it and come up with a plan to get it done, then implement it.

Goal Description
Build a robust CMS for the homepage that gives admins full control over:

Hero Slider: Cinematic top-of-page slides (Videos/Images/GIFs).
Content Sections: Dynamic product carousels (rows) below the hero (e.g., "Latest Drop", "Best of Hoodies").

the CategoryGrid section on the homepage to also have customizable media (Hoodies, T-Shirts, Pants, etc.) to also have customizable media

2. admin/customer/user with active session tokens should be automatically redirected away from the login page to the appropiate pages and on logout redirected is handled properly. and the sessions should last long. we wouldn't want users to be logged out every time they visit the store front.

3. a customer should be able to login from the store front 'login' buton. for admin login, you can just use url links. login should be handled properly and robustly. there should be no confusion between admin and customer login and logout and redirections
